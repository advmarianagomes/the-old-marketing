# The Old Marketing

## Project Overview
The Old Marketing is a simple yet elegant web page designed to promote a marketing immersion program that focuses on timeless principles that drive successful sales strategies. The page features a clear message about leveraging traditional marketing methods, complemented by a visually appealing layout and typography.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Open the HTML file:**
   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. There are no additional installation steps required, as the page is built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from CDN links.

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser of your choice. The webpage will display an overview of the marketing immersion program, highlighting its unique selling points and inviting users to engage with the content.

## Features
- Clear, responsive layout that adjusts for both desktop and mobile views.
- Custom typography using Google Fonts to enhance readability and aesthetic appeal.
- Use of Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling and layout management.
- Engaging content that communicates the value of traditional marketing strategies.

## Dependencies
This project leverages the following external resources:
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides an easy way to style the webpage.
- **Google Fonts**: For custom fonts (`Playfair Display` and `Roboto`) used in the project.

No backend or additional JavaScript libraries are required.

## Project Structure
Here's a brief overview of the project's file structure:

```
/<project-directory>
│
├── index.html            # Main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage
└── (additional assets)   # Any additional images or assets can be added here
```

You can expand this structure later to add more features or pages as your project evolves.
